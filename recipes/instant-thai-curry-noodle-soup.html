        <p>This recipe was inspired by instant noodle cups, but we wanted to make our own homemade version loaded with a rainbow of crisp vegetables and soft, slurp-able noodles. This is a quick, flavourful recipe that can be prepared in advance, ensuring that you have a mouth-watering meal ready in minutes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup (60 mL) coconut cream</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp (25 g) Thai green curry paste</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>4 oz (112 g) firm tofu, drained, cut into 1/2 cm cubes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (18 g) shredded red cabbage (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 carrot, grated (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 vegetable bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (15 g) fresh spinach, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1.8 oz (50 g) dry white vermicelli noodles</li>
            <li>2 cups (480 mL) boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optional garnish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>lime slice</li>
            <li>sliced green onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the coconut cream, Thai curry paste, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the tofu and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>If making a to-go meal, transfer the tofu to a mason jar or large heat-safe airtight container. If enjoying it right away, leave it in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer the cabbage, carrot, and bell pepper over the tofu, and crumble the bouillon cube overtop. Then add the spinach and rice noodles.</li>
            <li>Store until ready to eat.</li>
            <li>When ready to eat, add the boiling water so that all the ingredients are fully submerged, and stir. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes to soften the noodles. If after this time the noodles are not softened enough to your liking, it could be that the veggies were cold or the water was not hot enough. In this case, consider microwaving or heating on the stove for 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with desired toppings and a squeeze of fresh lime. Enjoy!</li>
